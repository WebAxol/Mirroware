# Mirroware   (Alpha)

Mirroware is a hybrid between two rendering systems: it takes the idea of traditional raycasting and combines it with raytracing concepts, such as reflections. This is the perfect combination between retro and modern graphics; you can make a game such as the classic <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> with the plus of having mirrors in a modern fashion!

Main features:

- Raycasting 
- Mirrors
- Textures

Features to be implemented:

- Sprite rendering
- Text rendering

<h2> What is Missing? </h2>

- Raycast optimization
- Complete and correct texturing system
- Camera displacement based on user inputs
- Further test raycasting algorithms
